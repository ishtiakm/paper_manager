# paper_manager
This program will help you manage the research papers you have read, so that later on when you will fail to recall the sources of a definite topic, you will be able to find it easily

It has three modes: write, search, tags
if you want to record the tags of a paper you will have to find later

In search mode, you can search by a keyword, then the names of all the papers with that keyword will apear, along with where they are saved

In tags mode, you can see all the tags you have used earlier and how many times you have used them.
